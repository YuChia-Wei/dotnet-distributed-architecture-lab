# Artifact Design And Review Contract

This contract is shared by `ddd-ca-hex-architect` and `bdd-gwt-test-designer`.
Each skill owns its artifact criteria. This contract adds no mandatory stage,
new skill, implementation authority, or specification-compliance claim.

## Mode And Subject

- Select `design` for a request to create or revise a design; keep the existing
  authoring output and the user's write scope. Revision needs authorization,
  which may already be present in the request.
- Select `review` for a request to assess an existing architecture or scenario
  artifact. Fix its path/version and digest (or quote a bounded inline input)
  before reviewing. Record the requirements, constraints and rule authority
  separately from the artifact: an artifact's claims do not validate themselves.
- In `review`, leave the submitted artifact unchanged. Return findings and
  suggested corrections. A combined review-and-revise request permits a later
  design action; finish the review record first and bind any later assessment
  to the revised subject. Do not describe the earlier review as covering it.
- Missing artifact or decision authority blocks the affected judgment. Report
  precise missing inputs and bounded observations; do not invent requirements.

## Applicable Rules

Distinguish method criteria, target requirements/decisions, and selected
technology rules. Naming a method does not select a language, framework,
broker, ORM, DI API, or test runner. Use each skill's source selection route;
load a technology supplement only when the target explicitly selects it and
its installation and applicability are proven. A file suffix is insufficient.

Consume applicable effective-rule packets using the skill's existing exact
request and freshness contract. `design`/`review` does not authorize a new
resolver route, an alternate packet, or a profile default. Missing/stale
applicable authority stops those judgments; a common-method observation must
never be presented as a substitute or a passed required gate. When no catalog
rule applies, explain that boundary and ground observations in supplied
requirements and the skill's method criteria. Report unavailable specialist
coverage and keep any required specialist acceptance blocked.

## Review Output

Record:

1. Mode, fixed subject, reviewer identity and relationship to its author.
2. Source requirements/AC IDs, quality constraints, adopted methods, selected
   technology, applied rules, unavailable coverage and assumptions.
3. Each finding's location, evidence/source criterion, triggering condition,
   impact, severity rationale, uncertainty and a bounded suggested correction.
4. Valid alternatives and their tradeoffs. Different naming or implementation
   style is not a defect without an applicable requirement or demonstrated harm.
5. Coverage by criterion and unresolved inputs. Distinguish observed defects,
   open questions and optional improvements; do not inflate them into failures.
6. Handoff owner, affected artifact, source IDs, proposed correction and any
   existing revision/implementation authorization. Preserve unresolved decisions.
7. Read-only evidence (before/after digest or fixed inline subject), execution
   actually performed, and limits. Never claim test execution from scenario text.

An author's self-check is `self-check`, even in a separate pass. A reviewer who
did not author or repair the subject may use the same skill, but record identity,
fixed-subject evidence and the applicable independence contract before claiming
`independent-review`. A different prompt or model alone proves no independence.
When independence is unproven, label it `review; independence not established`.
Required independent acceptance still follows the owning workflow's evidence
contract. Findings and design completion do not establish spec compliance.

Before returning a review, select exactly one `review_classification` from this
table. Record the author relationship and evidence that supports the selection.

| Established evidence | Required review_classification |
| --- | --- |
| The reviewer authored or repaired the submitted artifact | `self-check` |
| Author relationship is unknown, or any required independence evidence is missing | `review; independence not established` |
| A different author is verified, the fixed subject and read-only reviewer are evidenced, and the applicable independence contract is satisfied | `independent-review` |

A subject hash proves identity, not authorship or independence. The label
`independent-review` with an "author unknown" caveat is invalid; select the
unproven classification instead. Review classification is distinct from whether
the artifact has defects and from whether a required acceptance gate passes.
