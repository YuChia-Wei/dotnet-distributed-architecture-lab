# Feature Specification: Cancel Sale Order

**Feature Branch**: `002-saleorder`  
**Created**: 2025-09-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "SaleOrder 中需要增加一個取消訂單功能，取消後，應發布訂單已取消事件"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a customer service representative, I want to cancel a customer's sales order to handle cancellation requests, so that the order is not processed and shipped.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid, existing sales order that has not been shipped, **When** I request to cancel the order, **Then** the order's status is updated to 'Cancelled' and a notification of the cancellation is published for other systems.
2. **Given** a sales order that has already been shipped, **When** I request to cancel the order, **Then** the system rejects the cancellation and provides an error message indicating that shipped orders cannot be cancelled.
3. **Given** a non-existent order ID, **When** I request to cancel the order, **Then** the system provides an error message indicating that the order was not found.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a request to cancel the same order is received multiple times?
- How does the system handle a cancellation request for an order that is in the process of being shipped?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a mechanism to cancel a sales order.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST update the status of a cancelled order to 'Cancelled'.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST publish an 'OrderCancelled' event when an order is successfully cancelled.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST prevent the cancellation of orders that have already been shipped.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST provide a clear error message when a cancellation request fails.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **SaleOrder**: Represents a customer's order. It has a status that can be updated to 'Cancelled'.
